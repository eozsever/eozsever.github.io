                    <p>Erol Oz is a classically trained guitarist whose music defies genre boundaries. He is an award-winning guitarist and author who has been featured on radio stations across the country.

                    <p>Erol Ozsever (b.1985)–or Dr. Oz–was captivated by the sound of the electric guitar and began playing at age 10. He was inspired to study classical guitar after witnessing performances from world-renowned guitarists including Christopher Parkening, Manuel Barrueco, and the Romeros. His passion for music of all genres has led him on such creative pursuits as chamber music, rock bands, jazz ensembles, and producing popular music. He currently performs across the Tampa Bay area with One Night Rodeo and lead singer of the Erol Oz Trio. Erol’s original pop songwriting blends elements of folk and indie rock with colorful jazz chords and altered tunings.</p>
